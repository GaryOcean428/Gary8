# Gary8 Project

A multi-agent AI system inspired by leading frameworks including OpenAI Swarm, Microsoft Magentic-One, and AutoGen.

## Core Features

- **Orchestrated Multi-Agent System**: Coordinated agents working together to solve complex tasks
- **Specialized Agents**: Web browsing, file handling, coding, and system interaction capabilities
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Event-driven architecture for efficient agent interaction
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless integration with various tools and APIs
- **Dynamic Planning**: Adaptive task planning and execution with error recovery
- **Security First**: Built-in safety measures and sandboxed execution
- **Developer Friendly**: Comprehensive debugging and monitoring tools

## Architecture

The system consists of several specialized agents:
- Orchestrator: Coordinates overall task execution
- WebSurfer: Handles web interactions
- FileSurfer: Manages file system operations
- Coder: Analyzes and generates code
- ComputerTerminal: Executes code in a controlled environment
