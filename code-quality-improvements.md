# Code Quality Improvements

## RetryHandler.ts Refactoring

### Key Improvements

1. **Reduced Cognitive Complexity**
   - Split monolithic `execute()` method into smaller, specialized functions
   - Created helper methods for each logical part
   - Improved error categorization with dedicated methods
   - Enhanced readability with better variable naming

2. **Better Circuit Breaker Implementation**
   - Created enum for circuit states (CLOSED, HALF_OPEN, OPEN)
   - Added proper state management and transitions
   - Improved error handling with appropriate responses
   - Enhanced monitoring and logging capabilities

3. **Network Handling Improvements**
   - Better detection of network issues
   - More resilient wait-for-network implementation
   - Comprehensive error classification
   - Reduced false negatives and positives

4. **Documentation Enhancements**
   - Added JSDoc comments for all methods
   - Improved code readability with comments explaining complex logic
   - Enhanced variable naming for self-documenting code

## Sandbox Component Architecture

### Key Improvements

1. **Shared Base Component**
   - Created `BaseSandbox` component that contains all core functionality
   - Extracted code shared between `BenchSandbox` and `CanvasSandbox`
   - Reduced duplication and improved maintainability

2. **Specialized Component Wrappers**
   - `BenchSandbox` and `CanvasSandbox` now act as thin wrappers
   - Each provides specialized configuration for its specific use case
   - Follow composition pattern for better code reuse

3. **Component Organization**
   - Moved shared code to appropriate location
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Improved prop interfaces for better type safety

4. **UI Improvements**
   - Extracted rendering logic into separate helper components
   - Improved error and loading states
   - Enhanced accessibility

This refactoring reduces overall codebase complexity, improves maintainability, and follows React best practices for component architecture.
